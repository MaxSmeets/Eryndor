## Origins

> *"I am not cruelty—I am conclusion. Every flame that dims, every mountain that crumbles, every breath that stills—that is not malice. That is me, completing what was begun."*

Morthalas is one of the two primordial entities that existed before the world took its current form. He embodied **Mortis**, the inevitability of decay and entropy that ensures nothing lasts forever.

- **The Age of Silence:** Morthalas drifted through the primordial world as an unstoppable force of conclusion, causing all that grew to wither, all that lived to die, and all that existed to eventually return to stillness and dust.
- **The Eternal Dance:** He opposed Verdaniss ceaselessly, his touch unmaking everything she created in an endless cycle of creation and destruction.
- **The Binding of Balance:** When Zyr emerged to stabilize the world, Morthalas understood the necessity of order. He willingly became Zyr's advisor, representing the essential truth that all things must end so new things may begin.

Now he serves as Zyr's trusted counsel, representing the voice of completion, rest, and the natural cycle of decay. Though his primordial power has been tempered, he remains a colossal serpent whose scales are like ash, whose breath chills to the bone, and whose passing leaves silence in its wake.

## Appearance and Manifestations

Morthalas is depicted as:

- A colossal serpent whose ashen gray scales seem to absorb light, patterned with cracks like dried earth, constantly shedding dust and fragments
- Eyes like dying embers—dull red coals that see the end of all things
- A presence so still and silent that sound itself seems to fade in his vicinity

Manifestations in the mortal realm are subtle yet unmistakable:

- Sudden, peaceful deaths of the elderly or sick
- Structures aging decades in moments
- The quiet crumbling of ancient ruins
- A profound silence that brings acceptance and calm
- The scent of autumn leaves and cold stone

## Legends and Prophecies

### The Deathless Fool
A legend tells of a sorcerer who sought immortality and succeeded through dark magic. But Morthalas appeared, not in anger but in sorrow, showing the mage a vision of the universe: all his loved ones dying, civilizations crumbling, stars burning out, until he floated alone in eternal darkness. The sorcerer begged for death. Morthalas granted it as a mercy, teaching that death is not punishment but release.

### The Final Silence

> *"When the last tree withers, and the Heartwood's roots turn to dust,  
> The Silent End shall spread his coils across the world,  
> And all will return to the stillness from which it came—unless Verdaniss consents to withdraw."*

This prophecy mirrors Verdaniss's, suggesting that Morthalas could end all life but chooses not to, honoring his role in balance.

## Morthalas's Relationship with Mortals

Morthalas acts through gentle inevitability:

- Blessings: peaceful deaths, acceptance of loss, freedom from suffering
- Punishments: not punishment—merely the natural consequence of all things ending
- Direct action: appears only to those who truly need release or understanding of mortality

Those who fear him **suffer more than those who accept him**.

## Myths and Stories

### The Serpent's Gift
A warrior lay dying on a battlefield, crying out against the injustice of her death. Morthalas appeared, coiling around her, and showed her a vision: her death would inspire her comrades to win the battle, her sacrifice would save thousands, and her name would be remembered for generations. She smiled, accepted her end, and passed peacefully. Morthalas taught that even in death, there is meaning.

### The Pact of Balance
When Zyr first established the Heartwood, both Verdaniss and Morthalas were asked to merge their essences with it. Verdaniss agreed eagerly, but Morthalas hesitated—his nature was to end things, not sustain them. Zyr explained that the Heartwood would eventually die too, and when that day came, Morthalas's purpose would be fulfilled. Understanding this, Morthalas coiled around the tree opposite Verdaniss, and their combined power made the Heartwood eternal—until it isn't.
