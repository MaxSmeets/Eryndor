## Origins

> *"Before Zyr brought balance, I was the pulse of creation—endless, unstoppable, eternal. Every seed that burst from soil, every heartbeat that quickened with life—that was my song."*

Verdaniss is one of the two primordial entities that existed before the world took its current form. She embodied **Verdan**, the raw essence of unchecked growth and vitality that knew no limits or restraint.

- **The Age of Chaos:** Verdaniss roamed the primordial world as a force of infinite creation, causing forests to spring forth in moments, creatures to multiply without end, and life to flourish so wildly that it threatened to consume everything.
- **The Eternal Dance:** She clashed endlessly with Morthalas, her counterpart of decay, in a cosmic struggle that nearly tore existence apart.
- **The Binding of Balance:** When Zyr emerged to stabilize the world, Verdaniss recognized the wisdom in equilibrium. She willingly became Zyr's advisor, channeling her endless vitality through the framework of balance rather than chaos.

Now she serves as Zyr's trusted counsel, representing the voice of growth, renewal, and the persistent drive of life to continue. Though diminished from her primordial power, she remains a colossal serpent whose scales shimmer with living chlorophyll, whose breath causes flowers to bloom, and whose passage leaves trails of fertile soil.

## Legends and Prophecies

### The Overgrowing
Long ago, a desperate village prayed to Verdaniss directly, bypassing Zyr's balance. Their crops grew beyond measure—but so did the weeds, the pests, the disease. Within a season, their fields were an impenetrable jungle, and they starved amid plenty. Zyr intervened, teaching that even abundance requires restraint.

### The Whisper of Spring

> *"When winter refuses to release its grip, and the world grows cold and still,  
> The Ever-Living Coil shall stir from her counsel,  
> And with one breath, bring spring eternal—unless Morthalas consents to withdraw."*

This prophecy suggests that Verdaniss could force eternal spring, but chooses not to, honoring her role in balance.

## Verdaniss's Relationship with Mortals

Verdaniss acts through subtle encouragement:

- Blessings: enhanced fertility, bountiful harvests, miraculous healing
- Punishments: unchecked growth that overwhelms (as a lesson in balance)
- Direct action: rarely intervenes directly, but her essence flows through the Heartwood to those who need renewal

Those who pray to her without acknowledging balance **may receive more than they can handle**.

## Myths and Stories

### The First Heartwood Bloom
It is said that when Zyr first nurtured the Heartwood sapling, Verdaniss coiled around its trunk and breathed life into its roots. Her essence merged with the tree, giving it the power to anchor life itself. To this day, the Heartwood blooms with flowers that match her scales.

### The Serpent's Mercy
A tale tells of a hunter who mortally wounded a doe. As he approached his kill, Verdaniss appeared and offered him a choice: take the deer's life, or spare it and receive her blessing. The hunter chose mercy. The doe rose, healed, and bounded away. From that day, the hunter could heal wounds with a touch—but never again could he take a life.
