## Origins

> *"Before time was measured, there was only the clash of Verdan and Mortis—wild, untamed life and the creeping stillness of decay. From their chaos, Zyr emerged, not to conquer, but to balance."*

Zyr is the primordial deity who shaped the world from the violent collision of two fundamental forces:

- **Verdan** — the essence of unchecked growth and vitality.  
- **Mortis** — the inevitability of decay and entropy.

Unlike gods who favor one force over the other, Zyr exists to ensure neither dominates. The world, in Zyr’s design, is a delicate scale—one that must never tip too far.

## Appearance and Manifestations

Zyr does not take a single form but is often depicted as:

- A towering figure split in contrast: one radiant with blooming life, the other withered and skeletal.
- Two colossal intertwined serpents—one vibrant and the other ashen and still.
- A silent hooded figure with hands pressed to the Heartwood’s exposed roots.

Manifestations in the mortal realm are subtle yet unmistakable:

- Sudden blooming in barren soil
- A cleansing storm without destruction
- The awakening of a **Warden of Zyr**

## Domains and Influence

### Balance  
Zyr’s influence ensures harmony through:

- Seasonal cycles
- Predator-prey dynamics
- The rise and fall of civilizations  
- The very balance between life and death

### Creation  
Zyr shapes existence rather than **making from nothing**. The Heartwood, the Wardens, and wild magic are extensions of Zyr’s stabilizing will.

### Wild Magic  
Raw and uncontrollable — it **is**, not **controlled**. Those who attempt mastery are often consumed.

## Worship and Rituals

### Followers
Zyr is revered by:

- **Druids of the Green Pact**
- Philosophers and seekers of harmony
- **Wardens of Zyr**, silent instruments of balance
- Hermits attuned to nature’s rhythms

### Sacred Sites

| Location | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| **The Heartwood** | The center of Zyr’s presence — pilgrims offer paired opposites (water & stone, seed & ash). |
| **The Grove of Whispers** | Wind carries Zyr’s will to those who listen. |
| **The Ashen Vale** | Life and death coexist in perfect equilibrium. |

### Rituals

- **Rite of Equilibrium:** Meditations during solstices, burning a cherished item to signify acceptance of loss.
- **Offering of Duality:** Two equal and opposite items left at the Heartwood.
- **Vigil of Stillness:** Remaining motionless for hours to embody unyielding balance.

## Legends and Prophecies

### The Sundering  
A kingdom once tried to harness the Heartwood for immortality. The land rose and buried them — a warning etched into history.

### The Final Prophecy

> *“When the scales of the world snap, and the Heartwood weeps sap like tears,  
> Zyr will walk among mortals once more.  
> The Wardens will rise, and all will be judged—  
> not for their sins, but for the weight of their harmony.”*

Some call it doom. Others — renewal.

## Zyr’s Relationship with Mortals

Zyr acts through the world, not favors:

- Blessings: subtle, timely, lifesaving
- Punishments: inevitable consequences of imbalance
- Direct action: carried out by **Wardens of Zyr**

Those who disrupt harmony **face nature’s wrath**.
