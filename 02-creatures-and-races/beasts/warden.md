---

## Origins
> *"Before time was measured, Zyr carved guardians from the Heartwood’s bark and the strength of the mightiest stags."*

- **Creator:** Zyr, God of Balance
- **Purpose:** Protect the world from the violent clash of **Verdan** (wild, untamed life) and **Mortis** (decay and stillness).
- **Birth:** Not born, but **awakened** when the forest senses:
  - A massive imbalance
  - Defilement of nature
  - Threats to the Heartwood

---

## Description

### Physical Traits
- **Form:** Elk-centaur lower body, tree-warrior upper body
- **Skin:** Bark-like armor, hardened by centuries of slumber
- **Eyes:** Emerald, burning with Zyr’s will
- **Antlers:** Living conduits of forest magic
- **Blood:** Shimmering sap, linked to the Heartwood

### Aura
- Moss and fungi feed on their magic, not the other way around.
- Their presence warps the environment: storms form without clouds, time distorts, and illusions lurk in the foliage.

## Behavior

### Communication
- **Silent:** Do not speak, but **commune** through:
  - Thoughts carried by wind through leaves
  - Orders transmitted by shifting branches and roots

### Temperament
- **Unrelenting:** Merciless when defending balance, but not evil.
- **Judges:** Even druids fear their judgment.

### Social Structure
- **Solitary:** Each Warden is a force unto itself, but they share a hive-like connection to the Heartwood.

|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rooting Gaze**      | Can literally root a soul in place.                                                            |
| **Living Weapons**    | Bows and arrows grown from the Warden’s body; arrows sprout into binding roots on impact.      |
| **Magic Hum**         | Bowstrings hum when danger approaches.                                                         |
| **Elemental Grove**   | If a Warden falls, its body becomes a new grove, a permanent scar of magic.                     |
| **Time Distortion**   | Minutes may become days in their presence.                                                     |
| **Wild Magic Absorption** | Flora near them consumes mana—or flesh.                                                     |
