## 🎯 Key Concepts

### The Balance
At the core of Eryndor is the eternal struggle between **Verdan** (unchecked life and growth) and **Mortis** (inevitable decay and entropy). The god **Zyr** maintains this balance through the **Heartwood** and its guardians, the **Wardens**.

### Wild Magic
Raw, chaotic magical energy emanating from the Heartwood. Only those with a direct connection to Nythra can safely wield it—all others risk corruption or madness.

### The Heartwood
A colossal, ancient tree at the center of the primordial forest of Nythra. It serves as the physical anchor for the balance between Verdan and Mortis, and the source of wild magic.
